# js.bootstrap

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MiCHiLU/js.bootstrap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MiCHiLU/js.bootstrap)

## Introduction

This library packages [twitter bootstrap](http://fanstatic.org) for [fanstatic](http://getbootstrap.com). It is aware of different modes (normal, minified).

This requires integration between your web framework and `fanstatic`,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the `resources`
directory in `js.bootstrap`) are published to some URL.
